# ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ VN-Index Forecasting Dashboard
This project benchmarks modern time series models for short-term forecasting of the VN-Index, Vietnamâ€™s major stock market index. It is built to support investors, analysts, and financial platforms with daily updated forecasts and a live interactive dashboard.

## ðŸ§  Benchmark Models
We evaluate the performance of the following deep learning models:

LSTM â€“ Sequence learning using memory cells.

Transformer â€“ Attention-based model adapted from NLP for financial forecasting.

NeuralProphet â€“ Facebook Prophet extended with deep learning capabilities.

Exponential Smoothing â€“ Strong classical baseline for time series.

Each model is assessed on:

MAE / RMSE â€“ Accuracy of price level.

Directional Accuracy â€“ Correctly predicting upward/downward movements.

## ðŸ§ª Daily Forecast Automation
To update forecasts and keep the dashboard current: bash render_app/run_scrape.sh

This script:

Scrapes VN-Index data from StockBiz.

Process the data.

Precomputes forecasts for all models and saves to CSV.

## ðŸ“Š Live Dashboard
